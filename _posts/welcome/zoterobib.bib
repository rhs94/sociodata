	abstract = {This article integrates research on political psychology with welfare state development of social provisions aimed at mollifying unemployment and other conditions of life. Utilizing the typology of Esping-Andersen (1990), we examine three types of welfare state regimes: Liberal; Conservative; and Social democratic. The article compares the relationship between unemployment and subjective well-being across these regime types. We should observe that citizen preferences in social democratic countries will be most favorable toward government intervention in securing employment, and support for active government policies regarding employment and social welfare should be strongest there. In comparison, Liberal regimes such as the U.S.A. and Australia should be the least disposed toward such activity, while conservative regimes should fall in between. It is further hypothesized that differences in well-being between the employed and unemployed will be smallest in social democratic regimes. Our analysis indicates at best mixed support for the hypotheses. Our results lead us to the conclusion that the micro-foundations of macro-theories about the connection between public opinion and social security policies need to be reconsidered.},

	abstract = {Background: Although the effects of individual-level factors on wellbeing change following work exit have been identiﬁed, the role of welfare-state variables at the country level has yet to be investigated.
Methods: Data on 8037 respondents aged 50 years and over in 16 European countries were drawn from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). We employed multilevel models to assess determinants of change in wellbeing following work exit, using CASP-12 change scores. After adjusting for institutionally deﬁned route and timing of work exit, in addition to other individual-level variables, we tested country-level variables including welfare-state regime and measures of disaggregated welfare spending to determine their associations with wellbeing change and the proportion of between-country variance explained.
Results: Individuals whose exit from paid work was involuntary or diverged from the typical retirement age experienced declines in wellbeing. Country effects accounted for 7\% of overall variance in wellbeing change. Individuals residing in countries with a Mediterranean welfare regime experienced more negative changes in wellbeing, with a difference of –2.15 (–3.23, –1.06) CASP-12 points compared with those in Bismarckian welfare states. Welfare regime explained 62\% of between-country variance. National percapita expenditure on non-healthcare in-kind beneﬁts (services) was associated with more positive wellbeing outcomes.
Conclusions: National expenditure on in-kind beneﬁts, particularly non-healthcare services, is associated with more favourable wellbeing change outcomes following work exit in early old age. Welfare-state effects explain the majority of between-country differences in change in wellbeing.},

Although the research on time and well-being is extensive, few have dealt with them together from a comparative institutional perspective. Based on data from the third European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) of 2012, regarding 34 mostly European countries, in different welfare regimes, we explore two issues: (1) What are the effects of welfare regimes on the uses of time and subjective well-being? and (2) What are the effects of different uses of time on subjective well-being? We find that the institutional structure – the welfare regime – affects the way people use their time. Furthermore, the findings documented that uses of time have a direct effect on well-being when controlling for individual level as well as country-level variables. These findings may have important implications for policymaking.},

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether the magnitude of income-related health inequalities varies between welfare regimes (Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon, Bismarckian, Southern and Eastern). Specifically, it examined whether the Scandinavian welfare state regime has smaller income-based health inequalities than the other welfare state regimes. Methods: The first (2002) and second (2004) waves of the representative cross-sectional European Social Survey (ESS), which comprised more than 80 000 respondents, were used to analyse income inequalities (relative health difference between the first and third income tertile) in self-reported health (general health, limiting longstanding illness) amongst those aged 25 or more. Data related to 23 European countries classified into five welfare state regimes. The study controlled for age and adjusted for educational attainment. Results: When comparing the health of the first income tertile with the third, the Scandinavian countries only seemed to hold an intermediate position: they did not have the smallest, or the largest, health inequalities. However, the Anglo-Saxon welfare states had the largest income-related health inequalities for both men and women, while countries with Bismarckian welfare states tended to demonstrate the smallest. This pattern was unchanged after controlling for educational attainment. However, education seemed to explain the largest part of income-related health inequalities in the Southern regime. Conclusion: This study shows that the magnitudes of income-related health inequalities indeed vary by welfare state regime. However, this variation was not always in the direction expected as the Scandinavian countries did not exhibit the smallest health inequalities.},

We present three main ﬁndings: (1) individual-level characteristics, such as age, education, economic satisfaction, social network, unemployment, and occupational status are related to the health of individuals, both for women and men; (2) we tested how societal features, such as public expenditure on health, socioeconomic development, lifestyle, and social capital (social trust) were related to subjective health. Among the country-level characteristics, socioeconomic development, measured as GDP per capita (logarithm), is the indicator that is most strongly associated with better health, after controlling for individual-level characteristics; (3) the eastern European countries stand out as the countries where individuals report the poorest health. In our models, the individual-level variables explain 60\% of the variance between countries, whereas 40\% is explained by the macro-level variables.},

The major contribution to the literature is the use of an exogenous reduction in working hours, due to the Korean Five-Day Working Reform, in a subjective well-being (SWB) model. The ﬁndings indicate that reductions did not have the expected positive effects on worker well-being. While satisfaction with working hours increased, reductions had no impact on job and life satisfaction. Thus, long working hours might not be as negatively related to worker well-being as predicted by theory. Moreover, positive SWB effects might be offset by rising work intensity.},

The negative view is that part-time jobs imply wastage of resources and underutilization of investments in human capital since many part-time working women are highly educated. The positive view is that, without the existence of part-time jobs, female labor force participation would be substantially lower since women confronted with the choice between a full-time job and zero working hours would opt for the latter. In the Netherlands, the majority of partnered working women have a part-time job.},

This article answers these questions through within-person analysis of a nationally representative longitudinal survey from the United Kingdom. The results suggest that long working hours do not directly affect subjective well-being, but in line with theories of person–environment fit, both over-employment and under-employment are associated with lower subjective well-being. However, over-employment is more likely for those who work the longest hours. The duration of the subjective well-being penalty associated with over-employment and under-employment is typically short, but subjective well-being levels tend to remain depressed for those who remain over-employed for two years or more. Results imply that state and organizational policies that reduce the incidence of long hours working are likely to enhance aggregate well-being levels.},

This study investigates the role of working time preferences and hours mismatch for well-being among couples. The empirical evidence indicates that well-being is generally lower among those with working time mismatch. Particularly underemployment is detrimental for well-being. We further provide ﬁrst evidence on spillovers from the partner's working time mismatch that are, however, no longer signiﬁcant once we control for the partner's well-being. This suggests that well-being is contagious, and that the spillover is due to caring preferences.},

Using information collected by the 2001 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, this study examines the effects of underemployment on outcomes such as income, welfare dependence and subjective well-being. Results obtained imply that, while unemployment clearly has greater adverse consequences, underemployment is nonetheless associated with significant detrimental effects on the outcomes examined. Negative effects are found for both part-time employed and full-time employed workers who would prefer to work more hours, but effects are greater for underemployed part-time workers, and are particularly large for part-time workers who would like to work full-time. Indeed, for parttime workers seeking full-time employment, adverse effects attributable to underemployment are, for some outcomes, not far short of those attributable to unemployment.},

Actually, not only economists are interested in quantiﬁcations of happiness but also researchers in other disciplines. Notably there are several psychologists who investigate happiness as well. We mention Schimmack et al. (2002), Kahneman et al. (1999, 2006), Kahneman and Krueger (2006), Clark et al. (2008) and Lucas and Schimmack (2009). There are also some interconnections between happiness economists and psychologists as in the citations just mentioned. In this paper we will focus on happiness economics, although we will sometimes refer to work in other disciplines as well. Happiness economics is up to now an empirically oriented ﬁeld. There is no attention for philosophical contemplations on happiness, the sense of life, etc. as we ﬁnd in philosophy and religious studies (see, e.g., Feldman (2010), Nussbaum and Sen (1993), Haybron (2010) and Bok (2010) for a philosophical approach).

However, empirical research on subjective well-being has consistently shown that unemployed people are less happy than employed people, even after taking income differences into account.

We show that happiness and work hours exhibit an inverse U-shaped relation - working longer raises the level of happiness, as long as the total working time is not too long. Hence, working can be beneficial for happiness and, at the same time, it can exert a disutility at the margin.},

Results Tests of unidimensionality, and exploratory and conﬁrmatory factor analyses, revealed the presence of three subscales: community services, community attachment, and physical and social environment. To achieve adequate model ﬁt of the three subscales to the Rasch model, one item (distribution of wealth) of the initial 11 was removed and item response categories were rescored. The person separation index was 0.82–0.85, indicating a good reliability. All items were free from gender bias. The three subscales displayed satisfactory convergent validity with the PWI and NWI and were able to discriminate between groups with high and low satisfaction with local place of residence.
Conclusion The CWI, made up of three subscales, is a valid and reliable measure of subjective wellbeing related to the community as assessed by older adults. Further research with this promising measure should focus on cross-national comparisons.},

	abstract = {We estimate an ordinal logistic multilevel model to examine the determinants of the life satisfaction of employees in Europe. Data drawn from the European social survey reveals that deviations from desired hours of work (measured as the absolute difference between the actual and preferred weekly number of hours) reduce overall life satisfaction, but the effect is smaller in countries with higher unemployment rates. We interpret this ﬁnding as evidence that in environments where anxieties about job security are high, having a job brings about a certain level of life satisfaction regardless of the gap between the actual and preferred time spent in the labor market. We also ﬁnd no statistically signiﬁcant difference between male and female employees with regard to the impact of the work hours mismatch. This ﬁnding suggests that the gender differences which would have been expected in this context are already incorporated in the respondents’ subjectively determined desired hours of work. In fact, further examinations conﬁrm that ‘desired hours’ are associated with both socio-demographic characteristics (in particular, gender) and preferences for labor market work.},

	abstract = {This study examines the impact of working time mismatch (i.e. the discrepancy between actual and desired working hours) on individuals’ job satisfaction by disability status in Germany. Our particular interest is in testing the assumption that working time mismatch is a more serious problem among workers with disabilities as compared to workers without disabilities, especially concerning the presence of overemployment. Using longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (1985–2011), we estimate a ‘‘Probit Adapted OLS’’ model which allows us to identify the factors affecting job satisfaction for people without and with disabilities. The results indicate that all workers suffering from working time mismatch are more likely to report lower levels of job satisfaction compared to those who actually work their desired hours. In addition, all selected groups of females with disabilities prefer lower hours of work per week compared to females without disabilities. Although overemployment is clearly more harmful in terms of job satisfaction than underemployment for all workers, its impact is even higher for females with disabilities as compared to their non-disabled counterparts. From a public policy perspective, these ﬁndings show the importance of reducing working time mismatch in general and overemployment in particular among females with disabilities in order to increase their levels of job satisfaction.},

In addition, we examined the inﬂuence of working time-related variables including working-time mismatch, variability, shift work, and autonomy on the effects of LW and NW. This study used data from the 5th Korean Working Conditions Survey on 50,205 workers. LW and NW were deﬁned as 52–60 h (L1) or {\textgreater}60 h (L2) per week, and 1–10 days (N1) or {\textgreater}10 days (N2) of night work per month. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine the effects of LW and NW and the modifying inﬂuences of WCTV and occupation. Differences in ORs of LW and NW caused by working time-related variables were investigated, to determine effect sizes and directions. A high level of WCTV alleviated the risks of LW and NW. White-collar workers were more vulnerable to the risk associated with NW. Regarding working-time related variables, working-time mismatch and variability increased the risks of LW and NW, respectively, while shift work alleviated the risks of NW. In countries where ﬂexible work systems are not well utilized, working-time autonomy might not be associated with the risk of LW or NW. This study showed that it is necessary to comprehensively consider the occupation and task characteristics of individual workers performing LW or NW. Further studies of the modifying effects of working time-related variables on LW and NW are needed.},

	abstract = {Background: Recent trends on measurement of well-being have elevated the scientific standards and rigor associated with approaches for national and international comparisons of well-being. One major theme in this has been the shift toward multidimensional approaches over reliance on traditional metrics such as single measures (e.g. happiness, life satisfaction) or economic proxies (e.g. GDP).
Methods: To produce a cohesive, multidimensional measure of well-being useful for providing meaningful insights for policy, we use data from 2006 and 2012 from the European Social Survey (ESS) to analyze well-being for 21 countries, involving approximately 40,000 individuals for each year. We refer collectively to the items used in the survey as multidimensional psychological well-being (MPWB).
Results: The ten dimensions assessed are used to compute a single value standardized to the population, which supports broad assessment and comparison. It also increases the possibility of exploring individual dimensions of well-being useful for targeting interventions. Insights demonstrate what may be masked when limiting to single dimensions, which can create a failure to identify levers for policy interventions.
Conclusions: We conclude that both the composite score and individual dimensions from this approach constitute valuable levels of analyses for exploring appropriate policies to protect and improve well-being.},

This has led to the establishment of a ﬁrst set of indicators on quality of life and well-being and to a new instrument (the 2013 EU-SILC ad-hoc module for measuring subjective wellbeing). This new step in European statistics creates an important potential for researchers to engage in in-depth analysis and for national and European Union policy makers to use the resulting indicators—and in casu subjective well-being indicators—for developing and monitoring policy strategies and programmes.},

              From a public health perspective, the study of socio-demographic factors related to physical activity is important in order to identify subgroups for intervention programs.
            
            
              Objective.
              This study aimed to identify the prevalence of, and the socio-demographic correlates related to, the achievement of recommended physical activity levels.
            
            
              Methods.
              Using data from the European Social Survey round 6, physical activity and socio-demographic characteristics were collected, in 2012, from 39,278 European adults (18,272 men, 21,006 women), aged 18–65 years, from 28 countries. The question of meeting physical activity guidelines was assessed using World Health Organization criteria.
            
            
              Results.
              A total of 64.50\% (63.36\% men, 66.49\% women) attained physical activity recommended levels. The likelihood of attaining physical activity recommendations was higher in the 55–64 years age group (men: OR = 1.22,

	abstract = {Increased understanding of subjective well-being (SWB), as well as factors that influence it, are essential to enhance well-being at the individual and national level. We have applied a hedonic and eudaimonic 9-item composed tool (SWB score) to measure SWB across several Mediterranean (MED) and non-Mediterranean (non-MED) countries, and to explore the association between the SWB score and a range of sociodemographic, health and Mediterranean lifestyle factors. A specifically designed web-based questionnaire was distributed to adult participants (N = 2400) from Spain, Italy, Portugal, Bulgaria and Republic of North Macedonia. Results showed that the SWB score was significantly different across the examined countries with the MED participants displaying slightly higher average scores than the non-MED ones (6.3 ± 1.5 vs. 6.1 ± 1.6, p = 0.002). Several sociodemographic, health status and lifestyle factors displayed a significant but limited association with the 9-item SWB score, with a multiple regression model explaining around 17\% of the variance. Nevertheless, our results support that a closer adherence to Mediterranean lifestyle habits—the Mediterranean Diet, spending time with friends, family, and in nature, being active, and getting adequate rest at night—has a positive influence on the 9-item SWB score. Further research is needed to advance the understanding of the measuring and differentiating of SWB across different populations and to establish all the factors that influence it.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Governments around the world are now beginning to seriously consider the use of measures of subjective wellbeing (SWB) – ratings of thoughts and feelings about life – for monitoring progress and for informing and appraising public policy. The mental state account of wellbeing upon which SWB measures are based can provide useful additional information about who is doing well and badly in life when compared to that provided by the objective list and preference satisfaction accounts. It may be particularly useful when deciding how best to allocate scarce resources, where it is desirable to express the benefits of intervention in a single metric that can be compared to the costs of intervention. There are three main concepts of SWB in the literature – evaluation (life satisfaction), experience (momentary mood) and eudemonia (purpose) – and policy-makers should seek to measure all three, at least for the purposes of monitoring progress. There are some major challenges to the use of SWB measures. Two related and well-rehearsed issues are the effects of expectations and adaptation on ratings. The degree to which we should allow wellbeing to vary according to expectations and adaptation are vexing moral problems but information on SWB can highlight what difference allowing for these considerations would have in practice (e.g. in informing prioiritisation decisions), which can then be fed into the normative debate. There are also questions about precisely what attention should be drawn to in SWB questions and how to capture the ratings of those least inclined to take part in surveys, but these can be addressed through more widespread use of SWB. We also provide some concrete recommendations about precisely what questions should be asked in large-scale surveys, and these recommendations have been taken up by the Office of National Statistics in the UK and are being looked at closely by the OECD.},

Speciﬁcally, it explores whether the level of discretion given to employees in performing their jobs inﬂuences their SWB and whether this impact differs between women and men. Data from 20 European countries from Round 8 of the European Social Survey (ESS) are used to undertake an ordered probit analysis. Job discretion is approached through autonomy at work, supervision of other employees and inﬂuence on organisational policy decisions. Additionally, the individual’s educational level is controlled to further explore gendered differences of job characteristics on SWB. The results show that job discretion does indeed affect SWB, and this effect is different for women and men. Moreover, the effect of job discretion on SWB is not homogeneous across different education levels.},

	title = {Working hours mismatch and well-being: comparative evidence from {Australian} and {German} panel data},
	abstract = {This study uses subjective measures of well-being to analyze how workers perceive working hours mismatch. Our particular interest is in the question of whether workers perceive hours of underemployment differently from hours of overemployment. Previous evidence on this issue is ambiguous. We call attention to the level of well-being in the absence of hours mismatch that serves as a reference state for comparison purposes and to the consequences of restrictive functional form assumptions. Using panel data from Australia and Germany, this study estimates the relationship between working hours mismatch and well-being as a bivariate smooth function of desired hours and mismatch hours by tensor product p-splines. The results indicate that well-being is highest in the absence of hours mismatch. In general, the perception of overemployment is statistically signiﬁcantly different from the perception of underemployment in both countries. In Australia, workers tolerate some underemployment, as their well-being tends to be unaltered in the presence of short hours of underemployment. However, the marginal loss from underemployment appears to be larger than that from overemployment once the mismatch exceeds approximately ten hours. In Germany, on the contrary, underemployment is clearly more detrimental for well-being than overemployment. German males with preferences for full-time hours hardly respond to overemployment.},

Drawing on the 2014 Korean Time Use Survey data, the authors selected currently employed people aged 19–65 and examined the effects of total work hours as well as work schedules on feeling rushed, feeling tired, and life satisfaction. Based on the ordered logistic regression analysis, long work hours were negatively related to subjective well-being regardless of work schedules. After adding an interaction between standard and nonstandard work schedules, the study found that while work hours during both standard and nonstandard schedules are associated with declines in psychological status, the negative effect of working time during nonstandard work schedules on subjective well-being is stronger as the work hours during standard schedules decrease.},

From the national data of 29,336 participants in 13 provinces were reported that 13.4\% of the participants responded they were very happy, 78.6\% were happy, 7\% were unhappy, and 1\% were very unhappy. Ordinal regression models in particular proportional odds models were implemented on analyzing factors of the four levels of happiness. The significant variables associated with happiness were age, marital status, job status, education, satisfaction, economic level, health, and religious variables. Sex, hopeful, personality, and social relation were not significantly associated with people’s happiness. Happy people have higher probabilities of happiness than others. Very happy appeared to have lower probabilities of happiness as their ages increasing, while in contrast to unhappy and very unhappy people.},

	abstract = {Following theories of social and economic identity, we use representative data containing measures of personal identity to investigate the interplay of work identity and hours of work in determining subjective wellbeing (job satisfaction, job-related anxiety and depression, and life satisfaction). We find that work identity helps to explain wellbeing in two ways. First, for a given level of hours, having a stronger work identity is associated with higher wellbeing on most measures. Second, a strong work identity reduces the adverse effects of long hours working on some measures, notably job satisfaction and anxiety (for women) and on life satisfaction (for men). The associations of working hours and wellbeing confirm that work is a source of disutility, but these relationships are generally strengthened when controlling for identity – implying that individuals sort into jobs with work hours that match their identities. The effects of both work hours and identity are substantial relative to benchmark effects of health on wellbeing. Our work helps to rationalise recent findings in the literature on the effects of work hours and work hour preferences on wellbeing.},

Subjective well-being, which consists of cognitive factors such as life satisfaction and affective factors such as happiness, is affected by individual factors such as personality, gender, age, income, and marital status, as well as macro factors such as macroeconomic indicators, political institutions, and quality of society. Welfare-state types and the quality of social policies are also related to subjective well-being. This study demonstrates that the subjective well-being levels in institutionalized welfare regimes are higher through high levels of social expenditures and developed social services. Furthermore, differences between the lowest and highest income quartiles for subjective well-being are lowest in social-democratic welfare regimes.},

In the Netherlands and the UK it is fathers rather than mothers who are more likely to report conﬂicting pressures between work and family life.

Using data from the German SocioEconomic Panel Survey (SOEP), we study how the number of hours worked by the survey respondents and their partners influenced their own well-being. We also investigate possible transmission mechanisms between the two variables, namely income, hours spent in homemaking and care activities, and possible mismatch between desired and actual hours. Using Hybrid panel models we find evidence of different relations according to the respondent’s gender: Women report no change or lower satisfaction with the increase of their partner’s working hours, and the same holds true for men. However, own hours have a small non-significant positive effect on men’s life satisfaction, while they have the opposite effect for women. The presence of young children in the household and the addition of income to the regression equations further amplifies these results. Our conclusion is that respondents seem to experience greater life satisfaction when their and their partner’s behavior conforms to the roles of female homemaker and male breadwinner. Considering the absence of a strong mechanism related to time needs and time desires, we suggest those results are related to strong traditional attitudes towards gender roles and female labor force participation in the country considered.},

Fixed-eﬀects models are increasingly popular for estimating causal eﬀects in the social sciences because they ﬂexibly control for unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity. The ordered logit model is the standard model for ordered dependent variables, and this command is the ﬁrst in Stata speciﬁcally for this model with ﬁxed eﬀects. The command includes a choice between two estimators, the blowup and cluster (BUC) estimator introduced in Baetschmann, Staub, and Winkelmann (2015, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A 178: 685–703) and the BUC-τ estimator in Baetschmann (2012, Economics Letters 115: 416–418). Baetschmann, Staub, and Winkelmann (2015) showed that the BUC estimator has good properties and is almost as eﬃcient as more complex estimators such as generalized method-of-moments and empirical likelihood estimators. The command and model interpretations are illustrated with an analysis of the eﬀect of parenthood on life satisfaction using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel.},

Empirical tests using subjective wellbeing have produced mixed results and there are two reasons for being cautious. Firstly, the default reliance on the conditional mean can disguise uneven effects across the wellbeing distribution. Secondly, relying on respondents to deﬁne their settlement size does not ensure a consistent measure of the agglomeration. I therefore apply quantile regression to the life satisfaction and happiness measures of wellbeing as collected by the 2018 European Social Survey (ESS9) and employ a consistent local labour market-based deﬁnition of agglomeration—The Functional Urban Area (FUA). I compare three countries as proof of concept: one with a known strong negative (respondent deﬁned) agglomeration effect (Austria), one with a slight negative effect (Czech Republic), and one where living in the main agglomeration is positively associated with average wellbeing (Slovenia). The uneven wellbeing effect of living in the largest agglomeration in each country raises questions about who beneﬁts in which cities.},

Results: Using data from 22 nations and some 30,000 respondents, we find that worries about energy security reduce self-rated health. Partial proportional odds models suggest that this effect varies across thresholds of selfrated health, wherein individuals highly worried about energy security are significantly less likely to report “Very Good” self-rated health.
Conclusions: Worries about energy security reduce subjective well-being, suggesting another avenue through which energy relates to human health.},

	abstract = {Is Well-Being U-Shaped over the Life Cycle?* We explore the idea that happiness and psychological well-being are U-shaped in age. The main difficulty with this argument is that there are likely to be omitted cohort effects (earlier generations may have been born in, say, particularly good or bad times). First, using data on 500,000 randomly sampled Americans and West Europeans, the paper designs a test that controls for cohort effects. A robust U-shape is found. Ceteris paribus, a typical individual’s well-being reaches its minimum – on both sides of the Atlantic and for both males and females – in middle age. We demonstrate this with a quadratic structure and non-parametric forms. Second, some evidence is presented for a U-shape in developing countries and the East European nations. Third, using measures that are closer to psychiatric scores, we document a comparable well-being curve across the life course in two other data sets: (i) in GHQ-N6 mental health levels for a sample of 16,000 Europeans, and (ii) in reported depression and anxiety among approximately 1 million U.K. citizens. Fourth, we document occasional apparent exceptions, particularly in developing nations, to the U-shape. Fifth, we note that American male birth cohorts seem to have become progressively less happy with their lives. Our paper’s results are based on regression equations in which other influences, such as demographic variables and income, are held constant.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Studies have shown that perceived discrimination has an impact on our physical and mental health. A relevant part of literature has highlighted the influence of discrimination based on race or ethnicity on mental and physical health outcomes. However, the influence of other types of discrimination on health has been understudied. This study is aimed to explore how different types of discrimination are related to our subjective state of health, and so to compare the intensity of these relationships in the European context.
Methods: We have performed a multilevel ordered analysis on the fifth wave of the European Social Survey (ESS 2010). This dataset has 52,458 units at individual level that are grouped in 26 European countries. In this study, the dependent variable is self-rated health (SRH) that is analyzed in relationship to ten explanatory variables of perceived discrimination: color or race, nationality, religion, language, ethnic group, age, gender, sexuality, disability and others.
Results: The model identifies statistically significant differences in the effect that diverse types of perceived discrimination can generate on the self-rated health of Europeans. Specifically, this study identifies three well-defined types of perceived discrimination that can be related to poor health outcomes: (1) age discrimination; (2) disability discrimination; and (3) sexuality discrimination. In this sense, the effect on self-rated health of perceived discrimination related to aging and disabilities seems to be more relevant than other types of discrimination in the European context with a longer tradition in literature (e.g. ethnic and/or race-based).
Conclusion: The present study shows that the relationship between perceived discrimination and health inequities in Europe are not random, but systematically distributed depending on factors such as age, sexuality and disabilities. Therefore the future orientation of EU social policies should aim to reduce the impact of these social determinants on health equity.},

We ﬁnd both direct and indirect effects of education on happiness. First, we ﬁnd an indirect effect of education on happiness through income and labour status. That is, we ﬁnd that people with a higher education level have higher income levels and a higher probability of being employed, and thus, report higher levels of happiness. Second, and after controlling by income, labour status and other socio-economic variables, we ﬁnd that education has a positive (and direct) impact on happiness. We interpret this result as evidence of a ‘‘self-conﬁdence’’ or ‘‘self-estimation’’ effect from acquiring knowledge. Finally, we ﬁnd that the direct impact of education on happiness does not depend of the level of education (primary, secondary or tertiary).},

	abstract = {We provide a tutorial on differential item functioning (DIF) analysis, an analytic method useful for identifying potentially biased items in assessments. After explaining a number of methodological approaches, we test for gender bias in two scenarios that demonstrate why DIF analysis is crucial for developing assessments, particularly because simply comparing two groups’ total scores can lead to incorrect conclusions about test fairness. First, a significant difference between groups on total scores can exist even when items are not biased, as we illustrate with data collected during the validation of the Homeostasis Concept Inventory. Second, item bias can exist even when the two groups have exactly the same distribution of total scores, as we illustrate with a simulated data set. We also present a brief overview of how DIF analysis has been used in the biology education literature to illustrate the way DIF items need to be reevaluated by content experts to determine whether they should be revised or removed from the assessment. Finally, we conclude by arguing that DIF analysis should be used routinely to evaluate items in developing conceptual assessments. These steps will ensure more equitable—and therefore more valid—scores from conceptual assessments.},

Fixed-effects regressions are performed with German Socio-Economic Panel data (1984–2012) to investigate how a labor market switch from paid employment to self-employment inﬂuences life, work, and leisure satisfaction. The results indicate that switching to self-employment beneﬁts work satisfaction but not life satisfaction. The beneﬁts for work satisfaction are pronounced and relatively persistent but accompany large and persistent decreases in leisure satisfaction. Life satisfaction for the switchers to self-employment is consequently on par with the life satisfaction of the non-switchers. Contrasting the switch to selfemployment (out of paid employment) with the switch to paid employment (out of selfemployment) shows that the detrimental effect on leisure satisfaction distinguishes a switch to self-employment from a switch to paid employment. In conclusion, the results explain why increases in life satisfaction are generally absent for individuals switching to self-employment and why undetermined evidence has been found in previous studies in terms of gains in life satisfaction.},

In contrast, whether mothers spend more or less hours in employment hardly affects their life satisfaction. The rational maximization of income as postulated by family economics cannot explain these results, as they are even found in households where women earn more than men. Because they are also found among those who hold secure jobs and have very little household work and childcare duties, these results contradict the predictions by expansionist role theory that men and women are better off in egalitarian employment arrangements. The results change little over time, with cohorts or with educational group-membership. For men, the results therefore fit best with the predictions of traditional role theory, which suggests that people are most satisfied when adhering to stereotypical gender roles.},

In contrast, the life satisfaction of childless women is less related to long working hours, while the life satisfaction of mothers hardly depends on working hours at all. In addition, women and especially mothers are more satisfied with life when their male partners work longer, while the life satisfaction of men hardly depend on their female partners’ work hours. These differences between men and women are starker where gender attitudes are more traditional. They cannot be explained through differences in income, occupations, partner characteristics, period or cohort effects.

	abstract = {Med sin introduktion af begrebet ’konkurrencestat’ i en dansk kontekst tilbød Ove Kaj Pedersen et nyt teoretisk perspektiv på, hvordan den universelle danske velfærdsstat i et vist omfang er blevet erstattet af en neoliberal konkurrencestat baseret på markedstænkning. I denne artikel forsøger jeg at udbygge denne forståelse af konkurrencestaten ved at analysere udviklingen i Danmark fra velfærdsstat til konkurrencestat ved hjælp af Boltanski og Chiapellos teori om kapitalismens nye ånd. Igennem denne analyse søger jeg for det første at vise, at de værdier, som konkurrencestaten henviser til, når den retfærdiggør sin fordelingspolitik, ikke kun kan forstås som udtryk for markedstænkning. De må også i høj grad forstås som udtryk for idealiseringen af fleksibilitet, kreativitet og inklusion i arbejdsnetværk, som Boltanski og Chiapello identificerer som centrale i kapitalismens nye ånd, og som har rødder i venstrefløjens kapitalismekritik. For det andet er formålet med artiklen at diskutere, hvilke negative konsekvenser idealiseringen af fleksibilitet og omstillingsparathed samt det store fokus på kontinuerligt at opkvalificere borgere kan risikere at have for borgere og offentligt ansattes mulighed for at forholde sig kritisk til konkurrencestatens moralske legitimitet. 
  
ENGELSK ABSTRACT Jacob Didia Jensen: The new spirit of allocation policy With his introduction of the concept ‘competition state’ in Denmark, Ove Kaj Pedersen offered a new perspective on how the universal Danish welfare state has been partially replaced by a neoliberal competition state based on market logic. In this article, I seek to expand this idea of the competition state by analysing the Danish development from welfare state to competition state through Boltanski and Chiapello’s theory of a new spirit of capitalism. In this analysis, I seek to show, firstly, that the values used by the competition state to justify its allocation policy cannot only be understood as an expression of market logic. They must also to be understood as expressions of the idealisation of flexibility, creativity and inclusion in work-based networks, that Boltanski and Chiapello identify as central in the new spirit of capitalism, and which have roots in the left-wing critique of capitalism. Secondly, the article discusses how negative consequences the idealisation of flexibility, adaptability and the focus on continuously upgrading the skills of citizens in order to ensure their inclusion on the labour market impact on the ability of citizens and public employees to critically reflect on the moral legitimacy of the competition state.

Økonomisk vækst, konkurrenceevne og økonomisk holdbarhed, og 4. Beskæftigelse, arbejdsløshed og arbejdsmarkedspolitik. Sideløbende analyseres sammenhænge mellem dimensionerne, eksempelvis ligheds betydning for social mobilitet, vækst mv. På baggrund af den komparative analyse argumenterer vi for, at Danmark overordnet set kan karakteriseres som en universalistisk konkurrencestat med en lav grad af ulighed (om end den er steget) og fattigdom kombineret med en konkurrencedygtig og holdbar økonomi, der fastholder den traditionelle velfærdsstats fokus på social sikring og lige adgang til velfærdsservice, om end reformer af dagpenge og kontanthjælp har mindsket graden af sikring i forbindelse med arbejdsløshed. Som den største udfordring for den danske konkurrencestat peger vi på, at Danmark på trods af et stærkt fokus på området stadig er udfordret af, at erhvervsdeltagelsen blandt 25-54 årige mænd er væsentligt lavere, end den var før 1973 og end i de lande, der klarer sig bedst på dette parameter (Schweiz, Japan, Island). På denne baggrund diskuteres, hvad der skal til for at øge beskæftigelsesfrekvensen. 
 
 
ENGELSK ABSTRACT 
 
Mikkel Dehlholm and Ove K. Pedersen:  
Success or failure: a comparative look at the Danish competition state  
 
This article analyzes the Danish competition state in comparison with other western states on four dimensions: 1) inequality, poverty and tax, 2) social mobility, 3) economic growth, competitiveness and economic stability and 4) employment, unemployment and labor market policy. It also analyzes relations between these dimensions. Based on the analysis, we argue that Denmark can be characterized as a universalistic competition state. We point out that the greatest challenge for the Danish competition state is the low employment rate for men between the ages of 25-54, which is lower than it was in 1973 and also lower than other countries (such as Switzerland, Japan, Iceland). We discuss ways of increasing this employment .
